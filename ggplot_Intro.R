# Matplot function for visualization when working with matrices
# qplot function for visualization when working with dataframes

# ggplot function for charts and graphs
 
# Grammer of graphics is book
# create charts that tell us story and what are main components of it

# 7 Layers of information on your chart
# 1) Data
# u cant see the data/numbers on chart, data is somewhere in background
# eg 3 columns movie name, budget and genre is data

# 2) Aesthetics - an x-axis is aesthetics,colour & size are aesthetics
# Aesthetics is like mapping of ur data to chart u cannot again see it
# eg - using x-axis as aesthetics and the fill

# 3) Geometry is size of what (circle/square/dot/line), colour of what ?
# eg - geometry is bars in chart / bar chart

# 4) Statistics - make transformations to your data to create new variables 
# and visualize them
# eg - We r creating a bar chart which is also a histogram / distribution so we
# are running a statistics as we are creating a new variable i.e counting the
# no of movies acc to genre
# doing something to existing data to create new variables that u r going
# to visualize

# 5) Facets
# Facets means instead of 1 year u had different charts of different years

# 6) Coordinates - x-y coordinates, polar coordinates
# eg we have x-axis and y-axis, zoom in to some part of chart so everything
# to do with how you observe your data that is coordinates

# 7) Theme
# everything else u see on chart that is not related to data eg title,
# colour of x and y axis of labels, size of your text, legends
# Also called as non-data ink
