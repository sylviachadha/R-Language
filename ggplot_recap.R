# ggplot_recap

# Grammer of graphics having 7 layers

# Visualizations using layers and we have 7 different layers to use in
# our plots which are Data, Aesthetics, Geometry, Statistics, 
# Facets, Coordinates and Themes

# Factors in R r categorical variables

# Aesthetics and ggplot - x axis,y axis,colour,size

# Plotting with layers like visualization with lines and scatterplots
# did we want lines on top or scatterplot on top

# Overriding aesthetics like change size, colour etc

# Mapping vs Setting
# attach variable to aesthetic or set the colour to blue.
# for mappping need aes function for setting do not need aes function

# Histograms and density charts
# Histograms have fill which is inside colour and also have colour 
# which is the colour of the border of histogram and also just need
# 1 variable for histogram as bins are created automaticallyby R so
# in a way it is combining geometry and statistics

# Starting layer tips specify data now or later , specify aesthetics 
# now or in future, it all depends on what u want from ur visualization
# whatever u r going to be changing a lot in other layers do not
# include in starting layer else have to create base object again and 
# again

# Statistical transformations - geom_smooth, jitter, boxplot etc

# Facets allow u to create lots of different plots within 1 plot so
# basically recycle ur plot for different categories like year, Genre etc

# Coordinates 6th layer of visualization - how u can zoom into ur chart

# Themes - non data ink ways to make visualization pretty
