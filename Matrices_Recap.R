# Matrices SECTION RECAP
#------------------------

# R is a programming language for mathematicians & statisticians
# being strict about programming n being agile about data investigations

# a lot of data in world is stored in form of tables format and 
# matrix is 1 way of representing tables in R

# Building matrix using 3 functions
# matrix(), rbind(), cbind()
# matrix() function bends ur vector into a matrix whether row
# by row / column by column as specified
# rbind() & cbind() more common cz they combine existing vectors
# into matrices as rows or as columns

# Naming dimensions for matrix/vectors
# can give rows n columns names intead of using no of the row n no of
# then column n then address elements of matrix through names of row 
# n column. helpful when large dimensions of datasets.

# Colnames() and Rownames()
# allow to give matrix named dimensions

# Matrix operations
# add, subtract, multiply, divide, perform logical operations
# R by default performs operations element by element

# Visualizing with matplot()
# not a best tool for visualization, better options available
 
# transpose function (t function)
# matplot() requires a matrix but it visualizes it column by column
# r matrices were seperated by players (rows) so need to transpose
# matrix to visualize via matplot()

# Subsetting
# subset a matrix out of a matrix, subset single row/column from 
# matrix or even a single element from matrix
# drop() important feature while subsetting

# Creating a function

# Basketball insights, investigating data
